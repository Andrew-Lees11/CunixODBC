# CunixODBC

Intended for demonstation purposes only.

Swift module maps for [unixODBC](https://github.com/lurcher/unixODBC), which allow you to use the unixODBC C library in your Swift project.

Note - from Swift 4.2 you can pull the unixODBC library directly into your Swift project and will not need to use this repository (you can see an example of this in [Swift-Kuery-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-Kuery-PostgreSQL/tree/master/Sources/CLibpq)).

## Usage

#### Add dependencies

Add the `CunixODBC` package to the dependencies within your applicationâ€™s `Package.swift` file. Substitute `"x.x.x"` with the latest `CunixODBC` [release](https://github.com/Andrew-Lees11/CunixODBC/releases).

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Andrew-Lees11/CunixODBC.git", from: "x.x.x")
```

Add `CunixODBC` to your target's dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "example", dependencies: ["CunixODBC"]),
```

#### Import package

```swift
import CunixODBC
```

#### Build and test linking

You must have unixODBC installed on your machine:

- MacOS:
```
brew install unixodbc
```
- Linux:
```
apt-get install unixodbc-dev
```
Since brew doesn't install the files to the expected place you must provide a linker to swift for any project that depends on this:

```
swift build -Xcc -I/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.7/include
swift run -Xcc -I/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.7/include
swift test -Xcc -I/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.7/include
```

#### Using with Xcode:

You must add the xcconfig file from this repo to your project. Then generate the project using:
```
swift package generate-xcodeproj --xcconfig-overrides unixodbc.xcconfig
```
